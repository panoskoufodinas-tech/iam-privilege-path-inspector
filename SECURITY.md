# Security Policy

### Responsible Disclosure
As a White Hat security research project, we are committed to the principles of coordinated and responsible disclosure. **IPPI (Identity Privilege Path Identification)** is a methodology designed to improve cloud security posture through structural analysis. 

If you identify a functional security vulnerability or a systemic architectural flaw in a cloud environment using the IPPI framework, please prioritize reporting it directly to the affected vendor's official channels (e.g., Google Vulnerability Reward Program).

### Ethics and Compliance
The IPPI project operates under a strict "Logic-over-Exploitation" philosophy to ensure full compliance with vendor terms of service (ToS) and legal standards:

* **Static Analysis Only**: This tool is designed exclusively for read-only IAM reasoning and path discovery.
* **Zero-Exploit Policy**: This repository does not contain, nor will it ever host, functional exploit code.
* **Deterministic Safety**: All discovery logic is based on Logic 0.3 principles, ensuring that findings are verifiable and safe for production-level audits.

### Reporting Security Issues in this Tool
If you find a security issue or bug within the IPPI code itself, please open an issue on the GitHub repository or contact the author at **panoskoufodinas-tech**.
